Chris Cowan
CSE 210 Final Project

This project produces a program for a Sacrament meeting. The user can select what action they would like to do (Assign presiding, assign conducting, add speaker, add hymn, assign prayer).

Once an option is selected, the user is prompted to enter the necessary information to create that part of the program. 

After all information for the Sacrament meeting is entered, the user can choose to "Display Program", which presents all the information entered in an organized format which matches how a typical Sacrament meeting is done.
